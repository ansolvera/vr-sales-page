<p>For the past 14 years I’ve coached millions from around the globe through my digital platforms and live events and in that time have developed a reputation for helping people achieve the life they’ve always dreamed of.</p>
<p>The pinnacle of where I get to do this is in my Live Retreat program, the purpose of which is to take people through a fully immersive process to transform every aspect of not just their lifestyle, but their <strong>mindset, relationships, emotional well being</strong> and <strong>core confidence</strong> too.</p>
<p>There’s no denying that these unprecedented times have been something none of us could have ever planned for. It was the first time in over 10 years that we’ve had to postpone our Live Retreat, (and the Retreats mean the world to me and my team).</p>
<p>But instead of focusing on what we couldn’t do, we decided to figure out what we could do and adapt to the situation, even when the conditions weren’t perfect. And so, we created the Matthew Hussey Virtual Retreat.</p>
<p>This 3-day live stream event has been custom-designed by me and my incredible team to bring the same immersive magic of the Live Retreat straight to your computer in the comfort of your own home.</p>
<p>Being able to bring the Virtual Retreat to people all over the world during this time has been a truly special experience, and the feedback has been nothing short of incredible.</p>
<p>It’s for this reason, we’re doing it AGAIN this September 24th - 26th and I want YOU to join me.</p>
<p>I’ve gone to great lengths to make this experience truly life-changing. During these 3 unique and powerful days, I’m going to hand you <strong>the same proven tools and life-changing processes</strong> from my Live Retreat that has transformed thousands of lives for over a decade, with <strong>content customized and contextualized for this unprecedented time,</strong> so you can transform your life, too.</p>
<p>I’ll take you through the life-changing process LIVE online, alongside my team and an incredible tribe who are on the same journey, there to support you every step of the way.</p>
