                    <div class="prose__content">
                        <p>For the past 14 years I’ve coached millions from around the globe through my digital platforms and live events and in that time have developed a reputation for helping people achieve the life they’ve always dreamed of.</p>
                        <p>The pinnacle of where I get to do this is in my Live Retreat program, the purpose of which is to take people through a fully immersive process to transform every aspect of not just their lifestyle, but their <span class="highlight"><strong>mindset, relationships, emotional well being</strong></span> and <span class="highlight"><strong>core confidence</strong></span> too.</p>
                        <p>There’s no denying that these unprecedented times have been something none of us could have ever planned for. It was the first time in over 10 years that we’ve had to postpone our Live Retreat, (and the Retreats mean the world to me and my team).</p>
                        <p>But instead of focusing on what we couldn’t do, we decided to figure out what we could do and adapt to the situation, even when the conditions weren’t perfect. And so, we created the Matthew Hussey Virtual Retreat.</p>
                        <p>This 3-day live stream event has been custom-designed by me and my incredible team to bring the same immersive magic of the Live Retreat straight to your computer in the comfort of your own home.</p>
                        <p>Being able to bring the Virtual Retreat to people all over the world during this time has been a truly special experience, and the feedback has been nothing short of incredible.</p>
                        <p>It’s for this reason, we’re doing it AGAIN this September 24th - 26th and I want YOU to join me.</p>
                        <p>I’ve gone to great lengths to make this experience truly life-changing. During these 3 unique and powerful days, I’m going to hand you <span class="highlight"><strong>the same proven tools and life-changing processes</strong></span> from my Live Retreat that has transformed thousands of lives for over a decade, with <span class="highlight"><strong>content customized and contextualized for this unprecedented time,</strong></span> so you can transform your life, too.</p>
                        <p>I’ll take you through the life-changing process LIVE online, alongside my team and an incredible tribe who are on the same journey, there to support you every step of the way.</p>

That doesn’t mean your life is bad, it just means you know you need a change, but there’s something preventing you from making it. Maybe you’re obsessing over which is the right direction. Or maybe you think you know but you’re afraid of ‘How do I do it?’ or ‘What’s the first step?’. If you want to change your life, this 3 day event is going to help you decide what you really want, determine your life’s direction and show you how to get out of your own way so that you can start living it.</p>

                            <p class="text-lg">Is your love life still not where you’d hoped it would be by now? If you feel like no amount of dating advice has changed your love life, there may be deeper things holding it back. There are three things that create an incredible love life. The first is our confidence, the second is how we communicate our value to somebody else and the third is building a life that someone wants to be a part of. Any one of these 3 things not being where it should be has the potential to derail our entire love life. If you want to learn how to master all 3, then the Virtual Retreat is something that you must be a part of.</p>

                            <p class="text-lg">Are you tired of going through the motions and living on auto-pilot? The Virtual Retreat is going to show you how to get back out there and design what you want to happen as a result of this chapter. We’ll be looking at the intention behind every aspect of your lifestyle. What goals you’re setting for yourself, what books you’re going to read, where you’re going to visit, what you’re going to create, what your spare time looks like, what you’re going to transform in terms of your own limiting beliefs, your own confidence, your own piece of mind. And more importantly we’re going to be looking at WHY you want to make these new choices. Intention is so important and we’re going to spend those 3 days getting really clear about what we want to do in our lives over the next 12 months.</p>

                            <p class="text-lg">Did you think that with everything you've achieved in your life you’d feel more confident than you actually do by now? You see, people think confidence is this mysterious thing. It’s not. There is a practical roadmap to building confidence that involves how we talk to ourselves, how we forgive ourselves and building a life that makes us proud. If you want to learn this roadmap with me over 3 days of coaching immersion to transform your confidence once and for all, then the Virtual Retreat is for you.</p>

                            <p class="text-lg">Maybe you’re already doing great and just want to work on yourself to take things to the next level. There’s sometimes this perception that we should only be seeking out personal growth when things aren’t going the way we want, but the most successful people I’ve ever met are those that double down when things are going great. So if you’re just looking for some external influence and guidance to help you level up and keep your momentum going, then you’re going to love this program.</p>

TV is best, but a laptop or tablet would work great too.</p>

This isn’t about sitting back and simply listening, you’ll be actively participating in different journaling exercises, Q&A sessions and powerful visualizations. You’ll not just leave the event with a completely different mindset and confidence, but also an actionable blueprint for the next chapter of your life.</p>

These are some of my most trusted people and I can’t wait for you to speak with them. They’ve been working with me on this process for years and are on hand to hear your story. I promise, whatever the outcome, you’ll take value from the time you spend speaking with them.</p>

                        <p class="faq__answer" x-show.transition="open">I’ve spent years refining this process and it’s designed to go deep (often deeper than people are even expecting) into the core of who you truly want to be, which is why I have my team take people through this immersive experience personally. They’ll be able to share more with you about the transformative process, answer your questions and help you decide if the program is a good fit for you.</p>
